This Python script implements the Vigenere Cipher, a classic method of encrypting text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Features

- Encrypts text using the Vigenere Cipher
- Colorful console output with PyFiglet
- Input validation for uppercase text with no spaces
- Repeat key until it matches the length of the text
- Converts letters into numbers (0-25) before encryption
- Displays the initial text and key as numbers
- Option to try again or exit the program
